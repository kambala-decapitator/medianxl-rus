  Greetings, stranger. I'm not surprised 
  to see your kind here. Many 
  adventurers have traveled this way 
  since the recent troubles began.
   
  No doubt you've heard about the 
  tragedy that befell the town of 
  Tristram. Some say that Diablo, the 
  Lord of Terror, walks the world again.
   
  I don't know if I believe that, but a Dark 
  Wanderer did travel this route a few 
  weeks ago. He was headed east to the 
  mountain pass guarded by the Rogue 
  Monastery.
   
  Maybe it's nothing, but evil seems to 
  have trailed in his wake. You see, 
  shortly after the Wanderer went 
  through, the Monastery's Gates to the 
  pass were closed and strange 
  creatures began ravaging the 
  countryside.
   
  Until it's safer outside the camp and the 
  gates are re-opened, I'll remain here 
  with my caravan. I hope to leave for 
  Lut Gholein before the shadow that fell 
  over Tristram consumes us all. If 
  you're still alive then, I'll take you 
  along.
   
  You should talk to Akara, too. She 
  seems to be the leader of this camp. 
  Maybe she can tell you more.

  I've been leading my trade caravan 
  across the eastern deserts for more

  attacked by bandits and outlaws more 
  times than I can remember. But never 
  when a Paladin accompanied me. 
   
  Indeed, your Order has saved me from 
  losing a small fortune over the years. I

  The Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye has 
  a long and distinguished history. Over 
  the generations our Order has become 
  a deadly fighting force as well as a 
  bastion for women who sought to forge 
  their own destiny.

  Andariel.

  Regrettably, I could do nothing to 
  prevent the disaster which devastated 
  Tristram. It would appear that our 
  greatest fears have come to pass. 
  Diablo, the Lord of Terror, has once 
  again been set loose upon the world!
   
  As you know, some time ago Diablo was 
  slain beneath Tristram. And when our 
  hero emerged triumphant from the 
  labyrinth beneath town, we held a 
  grand celebration that lasted several 
  days.
   
  Yet, as the weeks passed, our hero 
  became increasingly aloof. He kept his 
  distance from the rest of the townsfolk 
  and seemed to lapse into a dark, 
  brooding depression. I thought that 
  perhaps his ordeal had been so 
  disturbing that he simply could not put 
  it out of his mind.
   
  The hero seemed more tormented every 
  passing day. I remember he awoke 
  many times -- screaming in the night -- 
  always something about 'the East'.
   
  One day, he simply left. And shortly 
  thereafter Tristram was attacked by 
  legions of foul demons. Many were 
  slain, and the demons left me to die in 
  that cursed cage.
   
  I believe now that Tristram's hero was 
  that Dark Wanderer who passed this 
  way before the Monastery fell.
   
  I fear even worse, my friend... I fear 
  that Diablo has taken possession of the 
  hero who sought to slay him. If true, 
  Diablo will become more powerful than 
  ever before.
   
  You must stop him or all will be lost.

  over the buried dungeons in that 
  god-forsaken wilderness, a solitary 
  tower, like some monument to Evil, is 
  all that remains.
   
  The Countess' fortune was believed to

  It is certain that we face the demon

  Ancient Horadric texts record that 
  Andariel and the other Lesser Evils 
  once overthrew the three Prime Evils -- 
  Diablo, Mephisto and Baal -- banishing 
  them from Hell to our world. Here, they 
  caused mankind untold anguish and 
  suffering before they were finally

  Diablo is heading east for some foul

  through the Monastery gate. 
  Obviously, Diablo summoned Andariel 
  to block any pursuit.

  Diablo's favor... the lesser demons are 
  always vying for positions of power 
  within the unholy hierarchy!

  For some time now, we have been under 
  siege by an evil power that I cannot 
  identify. Strange... It all began when a 
  Dark Wanderer came this way, looking 
  for the Tomb of Tal Rasha. No one 
  knows exactly where Tal Rasha, Keeper 
  of Baal, is entombed, but it is certain 
  to be far out in the desert.
   
  Now, my people whisper tales of the 
  dead rising from their tombs and 
  horrible creatures lurking amongst the 
  moonlit dunes. Even I have witnessed 
  things which I cannot explain. I've 
  ordered the port closed and all trade 
  ships moored until I am sure that my 
  city is safe.
   
  Atma, the tavernkeeper, has an 
  important mission for you. Go see her 
  immediately. You'll find her on the 
  other side of town.
   
  Now, I must return to the palace. I 
  apologize, but I can't invite you in. 
  Things are... rather a mess right now.

  For trade in magic and the like, see 
  Drognan or Lysander. Drognan is the 
  wisest man I know - without equal in 
  magic and ancient lore. Poor Lysander 
  is nearly deaf, but he's a reliable potion 
  chemist.
   
  For travel back west, see Warriv, whom 
  you already know.
   
  Our own Fara is a fine and honest 
  armorer, and she can heal wounds as 
  well.
   
  Elzix is the Innkeeper and may also 
  have some items to trade.
   
  Greiz, the mercenary captain I hired to 
  secure the gates of Lut Gholein, keeps

  Ahh... The lost Horadric Scroll! What a 
  fortunate turn of events...
   
  As the last living Horadrim, I alone have 
  knowledge of its meaning. Now, to read 
  the Horadric runes it bears. Hmmm...
   
  The Horadric Mages, after binding Baal 
  within Tal Rasha, magically sealed off 
  his Burial Chamber from the mortal 
  realm. Those same Mages also crafted 
  fearsome Horadric Staves and imbued 
  them with the special power to open 
  the Chamber's hidden door.
   
  After nearly losing one to the thievery 
  of a rogue sorcerer, they divided all 
  the Horadric Staves into two parts - 
  wooden shaft and metal headpiece - 
  hiding them separately to safeguard 
  them.
   
  The Horadrim foresaw our current 
  plight and designed the hiding places 
  to reveal themselves to worthy heroes 
  like you.
   
  Collect both parts of a Horadric Staff 
  and unite them using a Horadric Cube. 
  Then, you may enter Tal Rasha's Burial 
  Chamber.

  You have quite a treasure there in that

  Staff.
   
  To do it - use the Cube as you would a 
  scroll. When the Cube opens, place 
  both pieces of the Staff into it and use 
  the Cube's transmute power.
   
  You'll be pleased to know that the Cube 
  has other alchemical uses as well...
   
  Six gems plus one sword transmute into 
  a socketed long sword.
   
  You may also transmute two quivers of 
  crossbow bolts into one quiver of 
  arrows, while two quivers of arrows

  I've been researching the old records, 
  trying to find the location of Tal 
  Rasha's Tomb. Though I haven't found 
  the Tomb, itself, I may have a good 
  lead for you.
   
  The great Vizjerei Summoner, Horazon, 
  built his Arcane Sanctuary somewhere 
  around here. He was a powerful 
  spellcaster and kept demons as slaves 
  within the Sanctuary. He kept a close 
  eye on great events, too -- such as the 
  imprisonment of Baal within Tal 
  Rasha's Tomb.
   
  If you could find Horazon's Sanctuary, 
  I'm sure that it would hold some clue 
  as to the Tomb's location. Though I 
  doubt Horazon is still alive, you must 
  proceed with caution. There's no telling 
  what could be waiting inside.
   
  When I spoke of this with Lord Jerhyn, 
  he asked that I send you to him. 
  Perhaps he knows of a secret entrance 
  or the like.

  Ah, the ancient mage Horazon! He 
  believed that he could bend Evil forces 
  to his will. What he didn't know was 
  that Evil uses man, not the reverse.
   
  The Vizjerei still revere him as a symbol 
  of man's ability to triumph over other 
  worldly forces. The Church of Light, 
  however, cites him as an example of 
  man's folly.

  When the troubles began here, I allowed

  Screams echoed up the stairwells from 
  the harem. My guards arrived to find 
  the poor girls being slaughtered by a 
  merciless band of hell-spawned 
  demons. My brave guardsmen tried to 
  push the demons back into the 
  mysterious rift from which they came.
   
  Ever since, my men have fought a losing 
  battle. Demons have continued to pour 
  through the rift into the palace. 
  Ultimately, I hired Greiz and his 
  mercenaries to help protect the rest of 
  my fair city.
   
  Drognan believes that the Arcane 
  Sanctuary lies buried underneath this 
  palace, since Lut Gholein occupies the 
  site of an ancient Vizjerei fortress.

  Nearly a thousand years ago, Horazon 
  rose to the fore of the Vizjerei mage 
  clan. Horazon used the knowledge of 
  the Vizjerei to summon and control 
  demons from Hell.
   
  Though a powerful Summoner, Horazon 
  feared that the Lords of Hell would 
  punish him for enslaving their 
  brethren. Thus, the Summoner created 
  for himself an Arcane Sanctuary.
   
  He believed that his Sanctuary would 
  not only protect him from Hell's 
  vengeance, but also allow him to 
  continue his studies free from the 
  ravages of time and disease.
   
  Horazon had crafted many wondrous 
  scrying devices through which he 
  observed the events of the world 
  outside. It is certain that he took 
  careful study of Tal Rasha's 
  imprisonment and recorded the 
  location of his forgotten Tomb.
   
  The Arcane Sanctuary was believed to 
  have been constructed here in Lut 
  Gholein. An entrance may be hidden

  building is very old, and was once a

  The man you describe is probably not

  He sounds like the very mage who came 
  around here a while ago. He was very 
  curious about this palace and seemed 
  especially interested in the seal on the 
  passageway in the cellar. He left 
  shortly after that. I wonder how he got 
  down there? The seal was never 
  broken...

  in the passages beneath Tristram.
   
  No doubt the fool wandered into 
  Horazon's Sanctuary and lost whatever 
  was left of his ravaged mind. He is 
  beyond salvation. 
   
  It is possible that the fool has been 
  possessed by the spirit of Horazon. If 
  that's true, then you'd better put an 
  end to his tortured existence.
   
  Once done, I believe the demons who

  Drognan and I have concluded that the 
  Dark Wanderer who passed through

  Drognan believes that Diablo is 
  searching the desert for the secret 
  tomb where the great Horadric mage, 
  Tal Rasha, keeps Baal imprisoned.
   
  You must find Diablo and put an end to 
  the terrible evil that has fallen upon 
  our city. Drognan is wise and is sure to 
  have some helpful advice for you as to 
  how Tal Rasha's tomb may be found.

  The Tomb. May you be ready when you

  It is well-known that there are seven

  Tal Rasha's prison. You must explore 
  each of the tombs to find Tal Rasha's 
  exact location.

  Tomb as well... No one can guess as to

  The Archangel Tyrael was the one who 
  gave the Soulstones to the Horadrim 
  two hundred and sixty years ago.
   
  It is highly unusual for the forces of 
  Heaven to so directly interfere with 
  man's destiny, but Tyrael was said to 
  act of his own volition. We have never 
  been able to discern why.
   
  Perhaps, he goes against the consensus 
  of Heaven because he doubts our 
  ability to defend ourselves, or perhaps, 
  he sees more threat than his peers.
   
  Where the actions of Hell often seem 
  straightforwardly bent on destruction, 
  the motives of Heaven are 
  unfathomable.
   
  Now make haste... Both Diablo and Baal 
  must be stopped before they join with

  Never forget that your ultimate purpose 
  here in Kurast is to destroy Mephisto. 
  The ancient Horadrim imprisoned the 
  Lord of Hatred inside the Guardian 
  Tower that is located within the Temple 
  City of Travincal.
   
  Know this, friend. The only way to gain 
  entry to Mephisto's prison is to destroy 
  the artifact known as the Compelling 
  Orb.
   
  Mephisto used this device to control the 
  Zakarum Priests and their followers. 
  The Orb can only be destroyed with an 
  ancient flail imbued with the spirit of 
  the one incorruptible priest.
   
  Soon after his imprisonment, Mephisto 
  worked his evil corruption on the 
  Zakarum priesthood. All were turned to 
  his dark ways, save one - Khalim, the 
  Que-Hegan of the High Council.
   
  Mephisto directed the other Council 
  priests to slay and dismember Khalim 
  and then scatter his remains across 
  the Kingdom. The Priest Sankekur 
  succeeded Khalim as Que-Hegan, 
  eventually becoming the embodiment of 
  Mephisto here on the mortal plane.
   
  The corrupted High Council fashioned 
  an Orb to control the rest of the 
  Zakarum faithful and used their powers 
  to hide the lair of their master from 
  mortals.
   
  Your task is to collect the scattered 
  relics of Khalim - his Heart, his Brain, 
  and his Eye. Then, using the Horadric 
  Cube, transmute Khalim's Flail with his 
  relics.
   
  Once this is accomplished, you must 
  destroy the Compelling Orb with 
  Khalim's Will to open the way into the 
  corrupt sanctum of Mephisto.

  But now the time has come to face 
  those responsible for the evil that has 
  stifled our land. You must destroy the 
  High Council of Zakarum!
   
  Long ago, these elders were charged 
  with the stewardship of Mephisto, the 
  Lord of Hatred, who was imprisoned 
  within the Guardian Tower.
   
  Through the generations, these pious 
  men slowly fell more and more under 
  the sway of Mephisto's malevolent 
  power and the Council became an evil 
  mockery of its former glory. 
   
  It is Mephisto's Hatred that has 
  corrupted Zakarum and turned its 
  devout followers into paranoid 
  fanatics. That is why you must travel 
  to the Temple City of Travincal and 
  slay the Council.

  It is good to see you again, hero.
   
  Mephisto's defeat is a great victory for 
  the Light. I knew that you would 
  eventually find your way here. The 
  Pandemonium Fortress is the last 
  bastion of Heaven's power before the 
  Gates of the Burning Hells.
   
  This place has been hallowed by the 
  blood of thousands of champions of 
  the Light, many of whom were mortal, 
  like yourself. Now the final battle 
  against the Prime Evils draws near... 
  and you must face it alone. 
   
  I have been forbidden to aid you 
  directly, save for a few bits of wisdom.

  There is a dark, tortured soul who was 
  trapped within this forsaken realm long 
  ago. He was called Izual by mortal 
  men, and in ages past he was my most 
  trusted Lieutenant.
   
  Yet, against my wishes he led an 
  ill-fated assault upon the fiery 
  Hellforge, itself.
   
  Despite his valor and strength, Izual 
  was captured by the Prime Evils and 
  twisted by their perverse power. They 
  forced him to betray his own kind and 
  give up Heaven's most guarded 
  secrets.
   
  He became a corrupt shadow of his 
  former self - a fallen angel trusted 
  neither by Heaven nor Hell.
   
  For his transgressions, Izual's spirit 
  was bound within the form of a terrible 
  creature which was summoned from 
  the Abyss. His maddened spirit has 
  resided within that tortured husk for 
  many ages now.
   
  It seems to me that he has suffered 
  long enough. I implore you, hero, find 
  Izual and release him from his cruel 
  imprisonment.
   
  Put an end to his guilt and suffering.

  Though Izual no longer carries the

  within his new form.
   
  Also, he may not be able to tell friend 
  from foe while in his present state. If 
  you find him, he will almost certainly be 
  hostile.
   
  Proceed with the utmost caution.

  You see, it was I who told Diablo and his 
  Brothers about the Soulstones and how 
  to corrupt them. It was I who helped 
  the Prime Evils mastermind their own 
  exile to your world.
   
  The plan we set in motion so long ago 
  cannot be stopped by any mortal 
  agency. Hell, itself, is poised to spill 
  forth into your world like a tidal wave

  fear that we have been played for fools 
  all along.
   
  Izual helped Diablo and his Brothers 
  trick me into using the Soulstones 
  against them... Now the Stones' powers 
  are corrupted.
   
  With the combined powers of the 
  Soulstones under their control, the 
  Prime Evils will be able to turn the 
  mortal world into a permanent outpost 
  of Hell!

  Good riddance, freak.

  That couldn't have been Horazon. Poor wretch.

  He was not Horazon. He was a deluded fool who got too close to true power!

  This tomb is very ornate. This must be Tal Rasha's resting place.

  Is this the tomb I seek?

- # 1224
 k: |-1
  FindingdecoyTombSor
 v: |-1
  This tomb has Horadric markings. I wonder if this is Tal Rasha's tomb?

- # 1225

  This could be Tal Rasha's tomb. However, I'm sensing very strange energies here.

  Should I enter...? Diablo and Baal may have laid a trap...

 v: |-1
  Here, at last, is a fitting testament in stone to Tal Rasha's sacrifice.

 k: |-1
  FindingTrueTombSor
 v: |-1
  This must be the true Tomb of Tal Rasha!

- # 1230
 k: |-1
  FindingTrueTombNec
 v: |-1
  I sense an incredible aura about this tomb. The Horadrim hid something powerful inside.

- # 1231
 k: |-1
  CompletingTombAma
 v: |-1
  This is not good. Will this madness ever end?

- # 1232
 k: |-1
  CompletingTombBar
 v: |-1
  I have failed. Diablo has freed his accursed brother. The world remains at their mercy.

- # 1233
 k: |-1
  CompletingTombPal
 v: |-1
  I shall honor Tal Rasha's sacrifice by destroying all the Prime Evils.

 k: |-1
  FindingBeneathCityPal
 v: |-1
  The smell of death... or worse... surrounds me.

 k: |-1

 v: |-1
  It smells worse than rotting reagents down here.

  Good. Now I can get out of here and get some fresh air!

  Great. More junk. Just what I'd expect to find in a sewer...

 k: |-1

  This blade shall pierce the heart of evil!

- # 1265
 k: |-1
  CompletingBladeSor
 v: |-1
  I must take this to Ormus.

  This is a powerful weapon. Perhaps Ormus can tell me more about it.

  You've made it here... I've left this note 
  hidden here so that only a worthy hero 
  could find it. Our final confict, the
  Uileloscadh Mór, is upon us. Baal's 
  corruption has enveloped Scosglen, and 
  soon will spread in all of Sanctuary...
  
  Druids, over the centuries, have been 
  mastering the art of the Dubhdroiacht, 
  allowing us control over the forces of 
  nature. This forest is the birthplace 
  of our greatest creation: the Dúlra 
  Aegis. We must stop the Lord of 
  Destruction before he obtains it.
  
  Please, muster your resolve and look 
  for the other pages of my diary. Reach 
  the farmfields and look for a chest near 
  a hut, I believe you'll find it as this 
  message found you. Watch out, as
  bloody rituals are frequent in that area.

  This device was born from the desire to 
  protect our home during the foretold 
  calamity; but now, in a twist of fate, it 
  could grant Baal authority over 
  unspeakable power... thankfully 
  assembling it is far from a simple task. 
  The artifact itself was never completed 
  because of the threat of its potential 
  misuse, and the instructions were split 
  into multiple designs that Túr Dúlra 
  experts swore to protect.
  
  After harvesting the information he 
  needed, Baal has corrupted almost all of 
  the guardians! He has used the artifact 
  to reach an unknown location, hiding his 
  presence and pressing his advantages.
  
  Making our own Dúlra Aegis may be 
  our best and only step on the path to 
  his defeat.
  
  The third page of the diary is in a chest 
  nearby the Sky Altar, on a stony ground
  perpetually bathed by sunbeams. 
  It's south of the farmfields.

  Before building the Dúlra Aegis, several 
  tenets need to be crafted first. Obtaining 
  the design tomes by defeating the now 
  corrupted guardian Druids could prove 
  very difficult, but it's a necessity. Keep 
  also in mind that not all of them carry 
  the designs, but It's rumored that some 
  may even carry already crafted tenets.
  
  Intrepid warrior, you must press on or 
  all of our struggle will have been for 
  naught.
  
  After assembling all Tenets, look for the 
  fourth page of the diary: it's in a hut 
  close to the forest portal entrance, 
  where you first stepped here.

  These four diary pages you've collected 
  can be combined together and 
  transmuted into the final design for the 
  Dulra Aegis.
  
  Once you have the Dulra Aegis, you will
  need a special ingredient to breach into
  Baal's refuge. You need to travel to the
  cemetery at the East and look deep. The 
  Aegis will require much conjuring power.
  
  When you are ready to fight him, head
  to the Ancient Circle at the North East. 
  Beware as he has control over the 
  natural elements, you're not fighting 
  only him but also the twisted wrath of 
  these lands.
  
  It is now time to face our greatest 
  enemy. Prepare.
