  Praise be to the Light! You have 
  accomplished the impossible! 
  Diablo and Mephisto have been
  banished back into the Black Abyss
  that spawned them, and the corrupted
  Soulstones are no more.
  
  However, while you were fighting here,
  Baal remained behind in the mortal
  realm, building an army of hellish
  minions. Now, Baal's army is searching
  for the Worldstone, the ancient source
  of all the Soulstones and their power,
  while leaving behind a wake of
  destruction. They have forged deeply
  into the Barbarian homelands, heading
  directly for the summit of Mount
  Arreat!
  
  Baal knows, mortal hero! That is the
  very site of the blessed Worldstone!
  
  Now, enter the portal I have opened for
  you. It will take you to the Barbarian
  city of Harrogath, the last bastion of
  Order on the slopes of Arreat.

  During my time with the Horadrim, we 
  often debated the nature of Mount 
  Arreat.
   
  We knew that the Barbarian clans 
  zealously guarded the mountain as 
  their sacred duty. However, many 
  dismissed their zeal as simple 
  superstition...combined with an inborn 
  hostility toward outsiders.

  If you're here to defeat Baal, you must

  As we speak, Harrogath is under siege 
  by Baal's demons. Catapults rain death 
  just outside the town walls.
   
  Baal himself travels up the sacred 
  mountain, having left in charge here 
  one of his most vicious generals, Shenk 
  the Overseer. A ruthless taskmaster, 
  he lashes his own minions into suicidal 
  frenzies on the battlefield.
   
  If you wish to prove yourself to us,

  outside Harrogath. If you manage to 
  do this, return to me.

  One night, just before your arrival, I

  Anya came to me for guidance, after 
  receiving a vision that her mother and 
  younger brother were trapped in the 
  lands beyond the Ice Caves. She had 
  decided to go rescue them. 
   
  I told her that her quest was a foolish 
  one and that she would be safer 
  staying within the city walls. However, 
  she is a willful girl and would not listen 
  to me. 
   
  The next morning, she was gone. No 
  one is more distraught than I over

  Anya's father, Aust, was our wisest 
  Elder. He was killed along with the 
  other Elders who erected the ward that 
  protects this city. The ward has kept 
  Baal's demons out of Harrogath, but at 
  a costly sacrifice. 
   
  Nihlathak, on the other hand, was the 
  only Elder to escape the demons. 
  Somehow, he alone managed to find 
  sanctuary, while the others died 
  around him.

  Nihlathak told me he struck a deal with 
  Baal to protect Harrogath. In exchange 
  for the demon's mercy, the misguided 
  fool plans to give Baal the Relic of the 
  Ancients, our most holy totem!
   
  Doing so will allow Baal to enter Mount 
  Arreat unchallenged by the Ancients. I 
  tried to stop Nihlathak, but he 
  imprisoned me in that icy tomb.
   
  Nihlathak must be stopped before he 
  dooms the whole world. As much as I 
  would love to strangle the life out of 
  him, I'm afraid I haven't the strength.
   
  You must go to his lair through this 
  portal I've opened, kill him, and then 
  bring back the Relic of the Ancients.
   
  Stop Nihlathak from destroying what we 
  have striven for eons to protect.

  Regretfully, I know very little about this

  I saw Nihlathak leave town just before 
  you found Anya. He must be held 
  accountable for his criminal deeds.
   
  Find him and bring him back, if you can. 
  Likely, he won't come willingly, and 
  you'll be forced to kill him.
   
  So be it.

  Nihlathak is a traitor! If Baal gets the 
  Relic, he shall enter the mountain and 
  wreak havoc there!
   
  I cannot believe that Nihlathak would 
  give the Relic to Baal in any kind of 
  trade. He's truly insane if he believes 
  that he can deal with the Lord of 
  Destruction.

  You have stopped Nihlathak, but he 
  didn't have the Relic! He must have 
  already given it to Baal. Now, Baal will 
  not be tested when he reaches Arreat's 
  summit.
   
  ...Damn Nihlathak!
   
  I do thank you for trying, though. 
  Please, allow me to honor your courage

  Every time I hear of you, warrior, your

  But take heed. You are approaching the 
  very summit of Mount Arreat. I have 
  never dared venture there. It is sacred 
  -- our most holy place. The legends say 
  it is guarded by the Ancient Ones, who 
  block the path of all who are unworthy.
   
  Your reputation here does not

  You are a worthy hero! We augment 
  your skill and grant you entry to the 
  interior of Mount Arreat, wherein lies 
  the Worldstone.
   
  Beware. You will not be alone. Baal the 
  Lord of Destruction is already inside. 
   
  The Archangel Tyrael has always been 
  our benefactor, but even he cannot 
  help us now. For Baal blocks Tyrael's 
  spiritual presence from entering the 
  chamber of the Worldstone. Only you, 
  mortal, have the power to defeat Baal 
  now.
   
  Baal threatens the Worldstone -- and 
  through it, the mortal realm, itself. You 
  must stop him before he gains full 
  control of the sacred stone. With it 
  under his control, Baal could shatter 
  the boundaries between this world and 
  the Burning Hells, thus allowing the 
  hordes of the Prime Evils to pour forth 
  into the mortal realm like an 
  unstoppable tide!
   
  If you are weak, the world as you know 
  it could be lost forever. You must NOT 
  fail!

  I am impressed, mortal. You have 
  overcome the greatest challenge this 
  world has ever faced and defeated the 
  last of the Prime Evils. However, we are 
  too late to save the Worldstone. Baal's 
  destructive touch has corrupted it 
  completely.
   
  Given enough time, the Worldstone's 
  energies will drain away and the 
  barriers between the worlds will 
  shatter -- the powers of Hell will flood 
  into this...Sanctuary...and eradicate 
  your people and everything you've 
  labored to build.
   
  Therefore, I must destroy the corrupted 
  Worldstone before the powers of Hell 
  take root. This act will change your 
  world forever -- with consequences 
  even I cannot foresee. However, it is 
  the only way to ensure mankind's 
  survival.
   
  Go now, mortal. I have opened a portal 
  that will lead you to safety.
   
  May the Eternal Light shine upon you 
  and your descendants for what you've 
  done this day. The continued survival 
  of mankind is your legacy! Above all
